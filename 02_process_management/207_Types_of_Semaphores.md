# 207. Semaphores and Its Types

## 🧵 What are Semaphores?

**Semaphores** are synchronization tools used to manage access to shared resources among concurrent processes. They help prevent **race conditions**, ensuring processes interact safely.

## 🧩 Concept of Semaphores

- A **semaphore** is a variable used to signal the availability of resources.
- Uses two atomic operations:
  - `wait()` (or **P**) – Decrements the semaphore. If the result is negative, the process is blocked.
  - `signal()` (or **V**) – Increments the semaphore. If other processes are waiting, one is unblocked.
- Ensures that only a specific number of processes can access the critical section concurrently.

## ⚙️ Types of Semaphores

### 🔐 Binary Semaphores

- Only two states: `0` (locked) and `1` (unlocked).
- Also called **mutexes**.
- Ideal for **mutual exclusion**.
- **Use Case**: Lock/unlock access to a single shared resource.

### 🧮 Counting Semaphores

- Can take non-negative integer values.
- Value represents the number of available instances of a resource.
- `wait()` decreases the count; `signal()` increases it.
- If count is `0`, the process waits until another increments it.
- **Use Case**: Managing a pool of resources (e.g., DB connections, threads).

## 🆚 Semaphores vs Other Synchronization Tools

| Feature | Semaphores | Locks | Monitors | Condition Variables |
|--------|------------|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Mutual Exclusion | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ➖ |
| Counting Capability | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| High-Level Abstraction | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Used With Locks | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

- **Semaphores** offer versatility for managing both exclusive and multiple resource access.
- **Locks** are simpler but only provide exclusion.
- **Monitors** abstract both locking and condition management.
- **Condition variables** are used for complex waiting conditions inside monitors or with mutexes.

## 🚫 Deadlock Avoidance with Semaphores

- **Deadlock**: Two or more processes wait indefinitely for each other’s resources.
- Avoidance strategies:
  - **Resource ordering** – Request semaphores in a fixed global order.
  - **Timeout mechanisms** – Abort if blocked too long.
  - **Detection & recovery** – Periodically check for cycles and rollback.

## ⚠️ Priority Inversion & Semaphores

- **Priority Inversion**: A low-priority task holds a resource needed by a high-priority task.
- Solution: **Priority Inheritance Protocol**
  - Temporarily boost the lower-priority task to match the higher one.
  - Ensures critical sections finish faster, restoring correct priority levels.

## 🧪 Real-World Applications

- **OS Kernel Synchronization**: Manage access to internal resources like memory and I/O.
- **Thread Pools**: Regulate how many threads run concurrently.
- **Resource Pools**: Limit number of processes using hardware (e.g., printers, disk heads).
- **Database Connections**: Control number of concurrent sessions.
