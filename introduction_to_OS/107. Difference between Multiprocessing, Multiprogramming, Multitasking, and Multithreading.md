# 107. Differentiating Multiprocessing, Multiprogramming, Multitasking, and Multithreading

---

## üß† Multiprocessing

- **Definition**: System with two or more CPUs (processors).
- **Goal**: Increase processing power and parallelism.
- **Example**: A quad-core processor running different processes on each core simultaneously.

### Characteristics:
- Executes multiple processes in parallel.
- Each processor has its own set of registers and memory management.
- Ideal for computation-intensive applications.
- Increases system reliability and fault tolerance.

---

## üìö Multiprogramming

- **Definition**: Multiple programs reside in main memory and execute one after another.
- **Goal**: Maximize CPU utilization by minimizing idle time.

### Characteristics:
- CPU switches between jobs when one job is waiting for I/O.
- No true parallel execution ‚Äî just context switching.
- Increases throughput.

---

## üíª Multitasking

- **Definition**: Multiple tasks (processes) share the same CPU by time slicing.
- **Goal**: Enhance user interaction by allowing multiple applications to appear running simultaneously.

### Characteristics:
- Each task gets a short time slice of the CPU.
- Rapid switching gives the illusion of parallelism.
- Essential for desktop OS like Windows and Linux.

## üîÑ Multithreading

- **Definition**: A single process is divided into multiple threads that run concurrently.
- **Goal**: Improve the efficiency of a process by dividing its job into sub-tasks.

### Characteristics:
- Threads share the same memory space.
- Lightweight compared to processes.
- Faster context switching.
- Common in web browsers, video players, and game engines.
