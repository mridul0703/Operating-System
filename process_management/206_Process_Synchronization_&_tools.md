# 206. Process Synchronization and its Tools

## 🖥️ What is Process Synchronization?

**Process Synchronization** ensures that concurrent processes can operate without interfering with each other, particularly when accessing shared resources. It prevents issues like race conditions, data inconsistency, deadlocks, and starvation.

---

## 🧱 Key Concepts in Process Synchronization

### 🧩 Maintaining Data Consistency

- Shared resources can cause data inconsistency if accessed simultaneously by multiple processes.
- **Example**: In a banking system, two processes updating an account balance without synchronization might result in an incorrect final balance.

---

### 🧩 Preventing Race Conditions

- **Race Conditions** occur when the system’s behavior depends on the sequence of uncontrollable events.
- Synchronization ensures that critical section operations are controlled.
- **Example**: Two threads updating a shared counter without synchronization can cause an incorrect final count.

### 🧩 Avoiding Deadlocks

- **Deadlocks** occur when processes are blocked, each waiting for a resource held by another.
- Synchronization prevents deadlocks by managing resource allocation.
- **Example**: Two processes holding locks and waiting for each other can lead to a deadlock.

---

### 🧩 Fair Resource Allocation

- **Starvation** happens when a process is denied resources for execution.
- Fairness policies ensure all processes get a chance to execute.

---

## ✅ Synchronization Mechanisms

### 🧩 Locks and Mutexes

- **Locks and Mutexes** ensure mutual exclusion, allowing only one process to access the critical section at a time.

---

### 🧩 Semaphores

- **Semaphores** control access to resources using signaling mechanisms, allowing concurrent access while avoiding conflicts.

---

### 🧩 Monitors

- **Monitors** combine mutexes and condition variables to manage access to shared resources in a structured manner.

---

### 🧩 Atomic Operations

- **Atomic Operations** execute tasks without explicit locks, reducing overhead.

---

### 🧩 Condition Variables

- **Condition Variables** allow threads to wait for conditions to be met before proceeding, typically used with mutexes.

---

### 🧩 Read-Write Locks

- **Read-Write Locks** allow multiple threads to read concurrently, while only one thread can write at a time.

---

### 🧩 Barrier Synchronization

- **Barrier Synchronization** ensures all threads reach a specific point before moving on to the next task.

---

## ✅ Real-World Applications

- **Banking Systems**: Ensures concurrent transactions on accounts do not cause errors.
- **Multithreaded Applications**: Manages access to shared resources like databases and files.
- **Distributed Systems**: Synchronizes processes to maintain consistency across distributed environments.
- **Real-Time Systems**: Coordinates tasks that require timely execution, such as embedded systems.
