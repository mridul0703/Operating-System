# 203. Starving and Aging

---

### 🔹 Starvation in Process Scheduling

**Starvation** in process scheduling occurs when a process waits indefinitely to acquire CPU or other necessary resources, typically because other higher-priority processes keep getting executed.

This is most common in **priority-based scheduling** where low-priority processes can be ignored if high-priority tasks continuously arrive.

#### 🛑 Consequences of Starvation:
- Long wait times for certain processes
- Reduced system fairness
- Potential system instability due to uncompleted tasks

### 🔹 Ageing as a Solution to the Starvation Problem

**Ageing** (or **aging**) is a technique used to gradually **increase the priority** of a process the longer it waits in the queue. This ensures that even lower-priority processes will eventually be executed.

#### ✅ Benefits of Ageing:
- Ensures fairness in scheduling
- Prevents indefinite postponement
- Improves system throughput and responsiveness

### 🔸 Starvation and Ageing in Different Scheduling Algorithms

| Scheduling Algorithm | Starvation Possibility | Ageing Needed? | Explanation |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| FCFS                 | ❌ Rare                | ❌             | Handled in arrival order; no starvation |
| SJF / SJN            | ✅ Yes                | ✅             | Long jobs may starve; ageing helps promote them |
| Priority Scheduling  | ✅ High               | ✅ Required     | Lower-priority processes may never execute |
| Round Robin (RR)     | ❌ No                 | ❌             | All processes get CPU time in turn |

### 💡 Real-world Examples

- **System Maintenance Tasks**: A low-priority system update might never run if user applications keep executing. With ageing, its priority will increase over time and eventually run.
  
- **Network Packet Scheduling**: High-priority packets can dominate the channel; ageing ensures even low-priority packets eventually get transmitted.

### 🔧 Preventing Starvation in Scheduling

To avoid starvation, operating systems may implement:
- **Ageing** in priority-based systems
- **Round Robin Scheduling**, which inherently avoids starvation
- **Feedback Queues**, where a process can change its priority level
- **Maximum Wait Time**, forcing execution after a threshold

These techniques balance **efficiency** with **fairness**, ensuring that all processes progress and system performance remains optimal.
