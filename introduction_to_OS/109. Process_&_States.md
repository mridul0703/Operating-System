# 109. Process and Its States

A **Process** is an active task on a computer system that requires a set of resources, including memory, CPU time, and special registers to perform its functions. It is an instance of a program in execution.

A process can be considered as a unit of work submitted by the user. It consists of an executable program along with the associated data and resources required for its execution.

## Process Management

**Process Management** involves the activities related to the creation, manipulation, scheduling, and termination of processes in an operating system. It includes:

- Process creation
- Process scheduling
- Process synchronisation
- Inter-process communication

The primary goal is to allocate resources to processes in a fair and efficient manner to ensure optimal utilisation of system resources.

## Multithreading

**Multithreading** is the capability of an operating system to support multiple threads within a single process.

- A **Thread** is a lightweight process that shares the same memory space and resources with other threads in the same process.
- Multithreading allows concurrent execution of multiple threads within a process, enhancing CPU usage and responsiveness.

Threads can run independently but share:
- Memory
- Open files
- Code section

## Process Control Block (PCB) and Thread Control Block (TCB)

These are data structures used by the OS to manage processes and threads:

### ğŸ§± Process Control Block (PCB)

Created when a process starts, it stores:

- Process ID
- Process state (Ready, Running, Waiting, etc.)
- CPU register contents
- Memory management info (address, mapping)
- I/O status and file list
- Scheduling and accounting info

### ğŸ§µ Thread Control Block (TCB)

Created when a thread starts, it includes:

- Thread ID
- Thread state (Ready, Running, Waiting)
- Instruction pointer and CPU registers
- Scheduling parameters (priority, policy)

---

## Process States

A process transitions through multiple states:

1. **Hold** â€“ Job entered the system, waiting for scheduling.
2. **Ready** â€“ Job is ready and waiting for CPU.
3. **Running** â€“ Job is being executed.
4. **Waiting** â€“ Job is waiting for some event (like I/O).
5. **Finished** â€“ Job completed and released.

Schedulers involved:
- **Job Scheduler**: Transitions between Hold â†” Ready â†” Finished
- **Process Scheduler**: Transitions between Ready â†” Running â†” Waiting

## Process Creation and Termination

### ğŸ”¹ Creation
When a process is created, the OS performs:
- Memory allocation
- Initial PCB setup
- Unique process ID assignment
- Loading program and context

Involves system calls like `fork()` or `exec()` in UNIX.

### ğŸ”¹ Termination
On termination, the OS:
- Frees up memory and other resources
- Closes files
- Updates system/process tables
- Handles child/parent notifications

> ğŸ“˜ Process states and management are crucial for ensuring system efficiency, stability, and multitasking performance.
