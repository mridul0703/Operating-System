# 304. Dynamic Binding

## 📌 What is Dynamic Binding?

**Dynamic Binding**, also known as **late binding**, is a programming mechanism where the method to be called is determined at **runtime**, not during **compile-time**. It is a key aspect of **polymorphism** in object-oriented programming, allowing objects to be handled more generically.

### 🌐 How Dynamic Binding Works:
- A **base class pointer** can refer to objects of derived classes.
- The **method to be invoked** is determined based on the **actual type of the object** at runtime.
- Commonly used in **object-oriented languages** like Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

### 🔧 Example Use Case:
- In a program with a base class `Shape` and derived classes like `Circle` and `Square`, the `draw()` method can be called on a `Shape` pointer. The appropriate `draw()` method (from `Circle` or `Square`) is determined at runtime.

## 🌟 Benefits of Dynamic Binding

- ✅ **Flexibility and Extensibility**: New classes and methods can be added with minimal changes.
- ✅ **Supports Polymorphism**: Objects of different types can be treated uniformly.
- ✅ **Modular and Maintainable Code**: Code can be easily extended without modifying existing logic.

## 📌 Dynamic Linking vs Dynamic Loading

### 📍 Dynamic Linking
- Links required **libraries or modules** to a program at **runtime**, instead of during **compile-time**.
- The operating system loads these libraries when the program starts.
- Efficient because library code is **shared among multiple programs**.

### 📍 Dynamic Loading
- The application explicitly **loads or unloads libraries** at runtime.
- Commonly used for **loading plugins or optional modules**.
- Provides fine control over which modules are loaded.

### 🔍 Differences: Dynamic Linking vs Dynamic Loading

| Feature             | Dynamic Linking                                      | Dynamic Loading                                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Control              | Managed by OS at program start                       | Controlled by the application                         |
| Use Case             | Shared libraries used by multiple programs           | Plugins or optional modules loaded on demand         |
| Disk Space           | Saves space by sharing library code                  | Disk space depends on loaded modules                  |
| Flexibility          | Limited to OS-managed libraries                      | Highly modular, precise control over modules         |
| Error Handling       | Version conflicts may occur (e.g., "DLL Hell")       | Reduced version issues due to isolated modules        |

## 📌 Late Binding vs Early Binding

### 📍 Late Binding (Dynamic Binding)
- Determined at **runtime**.
- Supports **polymorphism and flexibility**.
- May lead to **runtime errors** if a method does not exist.

### 📍 Early Binding (Static Binding)
- Determined at **compile-time**.
- Faster because the method is known in advance.
- Less flexible as methods cannot be changed at runtime.

### 🔍 Comparison: Late Binding vs Early Binding

| Feature            | Late Binding (Dynamic)                  | Early Binding (Static)                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Timing              | Determined at runtime                    | Determined at compile-time               |
| Flexibility         | High (supports polymorphism)             | Low (fixed at compile-time)              |
| Speed               | Slower due to runtime method lookup      | Faster, no lookup required               |
| Error Detection     | Errors appear during runtime             | Errors appear at compile-time            |
| Usage               | Common in dynamic languages (Python)     | Common in static languages (C#, Java)    |

## 🌟 Benefits of Dynamic Binding

- ✅ **Greater Flexibility**: Methods are chosen based on the actual runtime context.
- ✅ **Supports Polymorphism**: Different classes can be treated the same way, enhancing code reuse.
- ✅ **Simplifies Code Maintenance**: New methods can be added without changing existing code.
- ✅ **Ideal for Dynamic Languages**: Languages like Python and JavaScript leverage dynamic binding for flexibility.

## ⚠️ Drawbacks of Dynamic Binding

- ❌ **Runtime Overhead**: Method lookup can slow down execution.
- ❌ **Runtime Errors**: Errors are found when the program runs, making debugging harder.
- ❌ **Complex Code Management**: Managing dynamic method resolution can make code harder to understand.
- ❌ **Risk of Type Errors**: In dynamically typed languages, it's easier to call methods incorrectly, causing runtime errors.
