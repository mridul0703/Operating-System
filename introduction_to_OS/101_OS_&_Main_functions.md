## 🧩 What is a Computer Made Of?
A computer comprises:
- **Hardware**: Physical components like motherboard, chips, and peripherals.
- **Software**: Programs and instructions that run on the hardware.

The **Operating System (OS)** connects these two parts, managing all interactions between software and hardware.
