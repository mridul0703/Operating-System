# 602. Security Threats and Vulnerabilities in I/O Systems

---

## Overview

I/O systems are critical pathways connecting a computer to external devices. Protecting these pathways is essential to ensure:

- Data **Integrity**
- Data **Confidentiality**
- Data **Availability**

However, these pathways face various security threats and vulnerabilities.

## 1. Data Interception

- **What it is:** Unauthorized access to data as it moves between devices.
- **Risks:**  
  - Data breaches  
  - Loss of sensitive information  
  - Unauthorized disclosure of confidential data
- **Prevention:**  
  - Use encryption protocols such as **SSL/TLS**  
  - Secure communication channels so intercepted data remains unreadable without keys

## 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

- **What it is:** An attacker secretly intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties.
- **Possible consequences:**  
  - Eavesdropping on sensitive conversations  
  - Injecting malicious data  
  - Modifying messages in transit
- **Prevention:**  
  - Implement strong **authentication** mechanisms  
  - Use robust **encryption** methods

---

## 3. Hardware Tampering

- **What it is:** Physical modification or compromise of I/O devices.
- **Examples:**  
  - Installing rogue devices (e.g., keyloggers)  
  - Modifying device firmware  
  - Installing unauthorized hardware to access data
- **Prevention:**  
  - Enforce strong physical security controls  
  - Conduct regular hardware inspections  
  - Use **tamper-evident seals** to detect unauthorized changes

## 4. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

- **What it is:** Overwhelming an I/O system with excessive requests to render it unusable.
- **Effects:**  
  - System slowdowns  
  - Crashes or unavailability
- **Prevention:**  
  - Deploy **firewalls** and **intrusion detection systems**  
  - Implement network traffic filtering and rate limiting

---

## 5. Buffer Overflows

- **What it is:** Occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold.
- **Consequences:**  
  - Unexpected system behavior  
  - Execution of malicious code  
  - Unauthorized system access
- **Prevention:**  
  - Follow **secure coding practices**  
  - Use automated tools for vulnerability detection  
  - Conduct thorough software testing

---

> Maintaining strong I/O system security requires a combination of **technical measures**, **physical controls**, and **secure development practices** to protect against these threats and vulnerabilities.
