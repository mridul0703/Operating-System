# 104. Types of Operating Systems

## 🧠 What are Operating System Types?

Operating Systems can be categorized based on:
- Response time
- Data input methods
- Process management approach
- Application domain

---

## 1️⃣ Batch Operating Systems

- Jobs are processed in **batches**, one after the other.
- **No user interaction** once execution starts.
- Best for **automating repetitive tasks** (e.g., payroll, large data processing).
- Focus on **throughput** — the number of jobs processed in a time period.

> 🧾 Example Use Cases:  
> Payroll systems, report generation, billing systems

> 🖥️ Example OS:  
> **IBM z/OS**

## 2️⃣ Multiprogramming Operating Systems

- Multiple programs reside in **main memory** and execute concurrently.
- CPU switches rapidly between tasks (context switching).
- Improves **CPU utilization** and reduces **idle time**.
- Appears to run multiple processes simultaneously (pseudo-parallelism).

> 🧾 Example Use Cases:  
> Time-sharing systems, web and database servers

> 🖥️ Example OS:  
> **Linux, macOS, Windows NT**

## 3️⃣ Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)

- Designed for **time-critical systems**.
- Guarantees response to inputs within a **fixed time window**.
- Suitable for **deterministic behavior** in safety-critical tasks.

> 🧾 Example Use Cases:  
> Aerospace systems, robotics, medical devices, control systems

> 🖥️ Example OS:  
> **VxWorks, RTLinux, ROS**

---

## 4️⃣ Distributed Operating Systems

- Manages a group of computers as a **single system**.
- Shares resources like CPU, memory, storage across a network.
- Supports file systems, communication, and process management across machines.

> 🧾 Example Use Cases:  
> Cloud computing, distributed file systems, P2P networks

> 🖥️ Example OS:  
> **Google File System, Apache Hadoop, BitTorrent**

## 5️⃣ Embedded Operating Systems

- Runs on **embedded systems** (chips in dedicated devices).
- Optimized for **specific tasks** and constrained environments.
- Highly **reliable** and **efficient** for low-resource systems.

> 🧾 Example Use Cases:  
> Smart TVs, washing machines, cars, medical equipment, IoT

> 🖥️ Example OS:  
> **FreeRTOS, Contiki, AUTOSAR, QNX, Android (smartphones), iOS (iPhones)**

> ⚡ *Each type of OS is optimized for a different environment — from handling multiple user programs to real-time responses in critical systems.*
