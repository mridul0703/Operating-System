# 301. Memory Management and Its Techniques

Memory Management involves handling and optimizing the use of the main memory. Its primary objective is to ensure that programs run efficiently by allocating memory spaces dynamically, keeping track of each byte in a computer's memory, and maximizing system performance.

Effective memory management is essential to avoid scenarios like **memory leaks**, which can degrade system performance over time, or **memory corruption**, which can lead to system crashes and unpredictable behavior.

## 🗃️ Memory Allocation Strategies

Memory allocation strategies are methods used to assign memory blocks to various programs and processes within a computer system. The most common strategies include:

- **Static Allocation**: Memory is assigned at compile time.
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Memory is allocated at runtime.

These strategies are crucial in managing the limited resource of memory, ensuring that all running applications receive the necessary resources while reducing wastage. Dynamic memory allocation techniques, such as **heap allocation** and **stack allocation**, allow for flexible and efficient use of memory, adapting to the changing needs of applications.

## 🧩 Fragmentation: Internal and External

**Fragmentation** in memory management refers to the inefficient use of memory that reduces the amount of usable memory. It occurs in two forms: **internal** and **external** fragmentation.

- **Internal Fragmentation**: Happens when allocated memory blocks have unused space within them, typically because the memory requested is slightly smaller than the allocated block size.
- **External Fragmentation**: Occurs when free memory is divided into small, non-contiguous blocks, making it challenging to find a block large enough to satisfy a memory request, despite having sufficient total free memory.

Both types of fragmentation can significantly impact system performance by reducing the effective memory available for applications.

## 📝 Memory Allocation Algorithms

### First Fit Algorithm
The **First Fit** algorithm is a memory allocation strategy that assigns the first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate the requested size. It scans memory from the beginning and chooses the first sufficiently large block it encounters.

- **Advantage**: Simple and fast.
- **Disadvantage**: Can lead to fragmentation over time.

---

### Best Fit Algorithm
The **Best Fit** algorithm allocates memory by searching for the smallest free block that can satisfy the memory request.

- **Advantage**: Reduces internal fragmentation.
- **Disadvantage**: Increases external fragmentation due to small gaps.

---

### Worst Fit Algorithm
The **Worst Fit** algorithm allocates memory by searching for the largest available block that can satisfy the request.

- **Advantage**: Reduces external fragmentation.
- **Disadvantage**: Can lead to inefficient memory usage if the largest blocks are not split effectively.

## 🪙 Buddy System Allocation

The **Buddy System** is a memory allocation technique that divides memory into partitions of size that are powers of two. When a request is made, the system splits the available block into smaller "buddies" until it finds a block size that best fits the request.

- **Merging**: If an allocated block and its buddy are both free, they are merged back into a larger block.
- **Benefit**: Helps manage fragmentation and maintains a structured method for splitting and merging memory.

## 🗂️ Slab Allocation

**Slab Allocation** is used primarily in kernel memory allocation, where efficiency and speed are crucial. It involves pre-allocating chunks of memory, called **slabs**, for objects of the same size. 

- **Efficiency**: Reduces fragmentation and overhead.
- **Application**: Effective in environments where objects of fixed sizes are frequently created and destroyed, such as operating systems.
