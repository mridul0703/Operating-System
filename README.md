# ðŸ§  Operating Systems Roadmap

A complete series to understand the internal working of Operating Systems. This roadmap is designed for students, developers, and enthusiasts to learn OS concepts with structure and clarity.

---

## 1. Introduction to Operating Systems

### OS and Main Functions  
What is an Operating System? How does it act as an interface between software and hardware? Learn the key responsibilities of an OS.

### Process, Program, and Thread  
Difference between a program, a process, and a thread. Understand how concurrent execution happens in systems.

### Types of OS  
Explore different types of operating systems like Batch, Time-Sharing, Distributed, Real-Time, and Embedded systems.

### Batch OS  
Understand how early operating systems worked without user interaction using job batching.

### Multiprogramming and Multitasking OS  
Learn how modern OS handles multiple programs and user tasks simultaneously.

### Kernel and User Modes  
Understand CPU privilege levels, protection rings, and how an OS separates critical and user-level operations.

### Process and Its States  
Explore the process lifecycle: New, Ready, Running, Waiting, and Terminated states.

### Normal Function Call vs System Calls  
Learn the key difference between regular function calls and system-level calls used to communicate with the OS.

## 2. Process Management

### Process Scheduling Algorithms  
Understand Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive scheduling and why CPU scheduling is essential.

### FCFS, SJF, SRTF, HRRN, RR, PBS, MLQ, MLFQ  
Dive into individual scheduling algorithms: their working, advantages, and practical applications.

### Starvation and Aging  
Explore how processes get ignored (starvation) and how aging is used to resolve it.

### Producer-Consumer Problem  
Classic synchronization problem demonstrating bounded buffer management using threads.

### Critical Section Problem  
Learn about safe access to shared resources using mutual exclusion principles.

### Process Synchronization and Its Tools  
Study tools like mutexes, monitors, and spinlocks to coordinate concurrent processes.

### Semaphores and Its Types  
Understand binary and counting semaphores with examples and use-cases.

### Deadlock and Methods for Preventing Deadlock  
What causes deadlock? Learn prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery techniques.

### Banker's Algorithm  
Deadlock avoidance algorithm used to allocate resources safely without entering unsafe states.

## 3. Memory Management

### Memory Management Techniques  
Learn how memory is allocated using First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit strategies.

### Virtual Memory  
Concept of extending memory by using disk space, enabling multitasking beyond RAM limits.

### Contiguous Allocation, Paging, Segmentation  
Understand different memory allocation strategies and their role in address translation.

### Dynamic Binding  
Learn how addresses and functions are bound at runtime instead of compile-time.

### Page Fault  
What happens when the OS cannot find a memory page in RAM? Understand how faults are handled.

### Page Replacement Algorithms  
Study FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms used to manage page faults.

### Beladyâ€™s Anomaly  
Counter-intuitive behavior where more memory leads to more page faults in FIFO.

### Thrashing  
Condition where a system spends more time swapping than executing due to overcommitment.

### Disk Scheduling  
Introduction to how disk access is scheduled to optimize read/write efficiency.

### Disk Scheduling Algorithms  
Study SSTF, SCAN, LOOK, C-SCAN, and other I/O access strategies.

### Cache  
Understand how cache improves memory access speed and why it's essential.

### Direct and Associative Mapping  
Explore memory mapping techniques for efficient cache use.

## 4. File Systems

### File System and Its Components  
Learn how OS stores, organizes, and provides access to files and directories.

### Types of File Systems  
Study common file systems like FAT32, NTFS, ext4, and more.

### File Allocation and Deallocation  
Understand techniques like contiguous, linked, and indexed allocation.

### Fragmentation  
What is fragmentation? Learn about internal, external fragmentation, and defragmentation tools.

---

## 5. I/O Systems

### Blocking vs Non-Blocking  
Explore how blocking I/O waits for completion vs non-blocking allowing multitasking.

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous  
Difference between sync and async operations in system I/O handling.

### Spooling  
Learn how I/O jobs are queued (e.g., print spooling) to avoid device conflicts.

---

## 6. Storage Management and Data Protection

### RAID and Its Types  
Understand RAID levels (0â€“6, 10), redundancy, and performance benefits in data storage.

### Security Threats and Vulnerabilities  
Study malware, access control, privilege escalation, and OS-level security features.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Additional Suggested Topics

### Booting Process and Bootloader  
Understand how the OS loads from power-on to login.

### Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)  
Used in embedded, industrial, and robotic systems where timing is critical.

### Shells and Shell Scripting  
Explore command-line interfaces and automate tasks using shell scripts.

### OS Design Principles  
Understand core architectural ideas behind building an OS, modularity, and performance.
