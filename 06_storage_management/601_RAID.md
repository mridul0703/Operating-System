# 601. RAID and Its Types

## What is RAID?

**RAID** (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a data storage technology that combines multiple physical disk drives into one logical unit to:

- Improve performance (speed)
- Provide redundancy (fault tolerance)
- Or both

Originally called "Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks," itâ€™s now known as "Independent Disks" to emphasize drive independence.

RAID is widely used in servers, workstations, and storage systems to enhance data reliability and access speed.

## Common RAID Levels

### RAID 0 (Striping)

- **How it works:** Data is split (striped) into blocks and distributed across multiple disks.
- **Advantage:** Significantly improves read/write performance by parallelizing operations.
- **Disadvantage:** No redundancy; if one disk fails, all data is lost.
- **Use cases:** High-speed requirements like video editing, gaming.
- **Storage efficiency:** 100% of total disk capacity.

### RAID 1 (Mirroring)

- **How it works:** Data is duplicated identically on two or more disks.
- **Advantage:** Provides full redundancy; can tolerate disk failure.
- **Disadvantage:** Storage capacity is halved due to duplication.
- **Use cases:** Critical data storage like databases, financial records.
- **Performance:** Improved read speed (reads from either disk), write speed similar to a single disk.

### RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)

- **How it works:** Data and parity info are striped across multiple disks; parity helps recover data if one disk fails.
- **Advantage:** Good balance of performance, redundancy, and storage efficiency.
- **Disadvantage:** Write operations slower due to parity calculation overhead.
- **Use cases:** File servers, backup systems.
- **Storage efficiency:** Capacity of (N-1) disks, where N = total disks.

### RAID 10 (Striping + Mirroring)

- **How it works:** Combines RAID 0 striping and RAID 1 mirroring.
- **Advantage:** High performance and fault tolerance.
- **Disadvantage:** Storage capacity halved due to mirroring.
- **Use cases:** Mission-critical applications requiring high availability and speed (e.g., transactional databases).
- **Fault tolerance:** Can sustain multiple disk failures if not both disks in a mirrored pair fail.

## RAID Summary Table

| RAID Level | Technique         | Fault Tolerance         | Performance         | Storage Efficiency     | Use Cases                        |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| RAID 0     | Striping          | None                    | Highest read/write  | 100% capacity          | Video editing, gaming            |
| RAID 1     | Mirroring         | High (1 disk failure)   | Good read, normal write | 50% capacity          | Critical data, databases         |
| RAID 5     | Striping + Parity | Can tolerate 1 disk failure | Good read, slower writes | (N-1)/N capacity       | File servers, backups            |
| RAID 10    | Striping + Mirroring | High (multiple failures) | High read/write    | 50% capacity           | High-performance, critical apps |

## Choosing RAID

- **RAID 0:** Use when speed is critical, data loss acceptable.
- **RAID 1:** Use when data safety is paramount.
- **RAID 5:** Use for balanced performance, fault tolerance, and capacity.
- **RAID 10:** Use for demanding applications needing both speed and redundancy.
